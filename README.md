# World-of-Warcraft Enhanced

## How's that work?

The world of warcraft will be start after cleared a clipboard memory. So the ALTgr can't be pasted into password fields, and your System clipboard will be recovery while the world of warcraft will stop or exited.

## Step to install:
Copy those file to the Wow root directory: `wow-enhanced.exe`

Then change your shortcut on your desktop to `wow-enhanced.exe`
