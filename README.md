# World-of-Warcract (ALT-GR-Fixer)

## How's that work?

The world of warcraft will be start after cleared a clipboard memory. So the ALTgr can't be pasted into password fields

## Step to install:
Copy those file to the Wow root directory:
    `CleanerWowExploit.dll, ClipBoardCleaner.cmd ,ClipBoardCleaner.lua, ClipBoardCleaner.vbs`

Then change your shortcut on your desktop to `*.vbs` as it that on the screenshot

And enjoys!
